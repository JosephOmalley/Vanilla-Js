# JavaScript-Projects
 A repository dedicated to JavaScript projects!
 
 Here are my vanilla JavaScript projects 
_________________________________________________

- jsCalc |
     This is a basic calculator that uses 4 operators and can handle decimals.
- Basic POS machine for ordering pizza  |
     This Js app adds together costs of size and toppings of a pizza than outputs a total.
- To-Do list |
     Allows uses to add tasks and remove taskes through a clean user interface.
- Tic Tac Toe |
   Allows user to play Tic Tac Toe with a computer and has sounds built in.
- [Hang Man](https://github.com/JosephOmalley/Vanilla-Js/tree/main/HangMan) | 
   This is my version of hangman. Heres how it works: 
     1. A model dialogue prompts the end-user to pick a category of words to guess. 
     2. A pseudo-random word is selected by creating a pseudo-random index with the length of the chosen category. 
     3. Once the pseudo-random word is chosen, a blank placeholder text is created displayed under keyboard.
     4. Now the users can start guessing the word by selecting a letter by using the on screen keyboard.
     5. If the guess is correct, the placeholder array is updated at the index where the guessed letter matches.
     6. In the case where the guess is wrong the script delegates to a function that adds a limb to the gallow.
     7. Steps 5 and 6 are repeated until the placeholder matches the word that was being guessed, or the man is fully hung. In either case the 
     window is reload and then the user is back at step one
